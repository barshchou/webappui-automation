We can run and "debug" Gh Actions on localhost 
using next library: https://github.com/nektos/act .

How to install (you will need to install Golang on your machine):
    1. Golang: https://go.dev/doc/install
    2. Install 'act' via golang: https://github.com/nektos/act#go-linuxwindowsmacosany-other-platform-supported-by-go

How to use:
    1. Verify that you installed act globally: run "act --help" in terminal
    2. Pull the docker image, which we use for our tests 
    (check "container" section in currents.yml or full_reports.yml in workflows).
    3. Create '.secrets' file '.act' dir. Purpose of this file is to emulate secrets we use in GH Actions.
    Example of this file is ".secrets.example". Copy USERNAME and PASSWORD that you have in 'cypress.env.json'.
    More about this: https://github.com/nektos/act#secrets
    4. Use 'debug.json' to emulate events from GH Actions. Example of this file is "debug.example.json".
    You can set there anything that should be set from UI, or triggered by 'github.event'
    More about this: https://github.com/nektos/act#events
    5. !!! USE ONLY JOB WHICH IS DESCRIBED IN 'debug.yml'. You wouldn't like to have 10 containers as we use in currents / full_reports yml.
    So please, use 'debug.yml' for all debug 
    6. Run 'act' via 'npm run act:debug'. 
    You can of course run this as it is by calling 'act' with the rest of the args,
    but npm script is a bit convinient. Change args in npm script if you wish so.
