The equity dividend rate is an equity capitalization that reflects all benefits that can be recognized by the equity investor as of the date of purchase. We selected this rate based on the subject's location in a good residential area, and its good access and visibility. We summarize the mortgage and equity parameters utilized in our derivation of an overall capitalization rate."
