    "The new tax rates were not in place for the July 1, 2021 tax bills; as such, " +
    "the previous year tax rate was initially applied to the July 2021 tax bills and adjustments were " +
    "then made to subsequent tax bills to reflect the change in rate for any overpayment or underpayment. " +
    "The new tax rates are reflected in the second half of tax year bills, " +
    "which represent a blend of the initial tax rate in place in July of 2021 and " +
    "second half of the fiscal year to achieve the actual 2021/22 tax rate. " +
    "For the subject, we have applied the appropriate 2021/22 fiscal year tax rate " +
    "to the most recent assessed value of the property to determine its current tax liability.",
